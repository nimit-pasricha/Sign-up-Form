# Sign-up-Form

A form for an imaginary service (with no backend) made with HTML and CSS

This is my first somewhat responsive webpage. It doesn't always look perfect but is <em>significantly</em> more impressive at retaining the flow of the page for almost all desktop and phone resolutions.

<div>Some Notes: </div>
<ul>
  <li>On a few mobile resolutions, the form input fields take up the whole width of the screen (which works but looks very ugly). I should be able to fix this once I learn media-queries and somehow move the side-bar to the top. This should give me more space for the input fields.</li>
  <li>Length units vh and vw ended up being a lot more useful than I expected, especially when trying to make my page work for all desktop-resolutions and window-sizes.</li>
  <li>The page handles different browsers fonts pretty well. I have learned about and started using rem (and em) almost exclusively for my page's font-size
  </li>
  <li>I have also used rem and em for some of my non-font measurements which has helped resize some elements (like the translucent box around the ODIN title) when font-size is changed to make it look equally as pretty for different font sizes.</li>
  <li>Checking if the two password fields match would require Javascript. I have not yet learned to validate forms using Javascript and <em>may</em> come back to this project to implement it later. For now, it just independently validates both password fields</li>
<ul>
